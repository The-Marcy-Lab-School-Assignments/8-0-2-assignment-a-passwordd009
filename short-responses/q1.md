# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
It's going to be accesible to other developers, to secure the key you must place it in the env so then it's not visible.

This is sort of right but you need to add clarity because the frontend can have `env` files too but that won't stop the API Key from becoming exposed. The problem is that when the frontend sends a request, if the API key is a part of the request it will show up in the developer console's Network tab, even if the value is stored in an env file.

Fetching on the server fixes this by using the API key in a place that the client can't see. The client just requests the server to make the request on their behalf.
