# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Making an API requests with API keys from the front end is dangerous because it makes the API key accessbile to users on the browser by it being displayed in the network tab of the dev tools.

The way servers combat this is by making the fetch using the API key and allowing the front end to access the data by creating a new endpoint. This lets the developer keep the API key hidden on the server.

This is sort of right but you need to add clarity because the frontend can have `env` files too but that won't stop the API Key from becoming exposed. The problem is that when the frontend sends a request, if the API key is a part of the request it will show up in the developer console's Network tab, even if the value is stored in an env file.

Fetching on the server fixes this by using the API key in a place that the client can't see. The client just requests the server to make the request on their behalf.
